* Bugs [2/2]
+ [X] iTime doesn't have a starting time
+ [X] unimplemented intrinsics (eg. smoothstep) on CPU cause an error because of sc_eval
  - Turned out to be about wrong join order of scopes; the global (unimplemented) smoothstep was shadowing the SPIR-V one.
* Features [0/7]
+ [-] shadertoy variables for Image Shaders [6/10]
  + [X] vec3 iResolution
  + [X] float iTime
  + [X] float iTimeDelta (seconds)
  + [X] float iFrame  (frame count from beginning)
  + [ ] float iChannelTime[4] (?)
  + [X] vec4 iMouse
  + [X] vec4 iDate
  + [ ] float iSampleRate
  + [ ] vec3 iChannelResolution (?)
  + [ ] samplerXX iChannel(0..3) (?)
+ [ ] info bar showing current time, frame, button for restarting shader [0/2]
  + [ ] add imgui integration
  + [ ] shader initial state setting
+ [ ] ability to pop off shader into a virtual window
+ [ ] support for internal resolution
+ [ ] pass shader file(s) as CLI argument
+ [ ] support for non-scopes GLSL
